# Regular-Expression-Form
A basic input form that utilises regular expression. I created this using Net Ninja's regular expression course to familiarise myself further with regex. The full course is available on Youtube for those that wish to have a nice regex refresher.

The HTML and CSS are available from: https://github.com/iamshaunjp/regex-playlist and the full course playlist is available at: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9g6m_6Sld9Q4jzqdqHd2HiD. As of 12th May 2024, there are no issues with the code, however there is some use of the outdated 'var' assignment keyword which will still work, however, it is best to replace these with 'const'.

During the creation of the 'telephone' regex, there is a demonstration of the code in use in the terminal which does not work. It states that there is an issue with the event listener however, there is no issue with the code itself and once the full course is complete the code works perfectly.

The course utilises the regrex101 website which can be found here: https://regex101.com/.
